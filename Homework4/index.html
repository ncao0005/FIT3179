    <h1>The impact of Covid-19 on international flights</h1>
     
    <div id="text">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>When the coronavirus first broke out in China in December 2019, no one knew what impact it would have on Australia and the world. The visualization will review the impact of COVID-19 on Australia's international flight market by counting the total number of flights boarding and deplaning at Melbourne Airport.</p>

      <h2>Map Analysis</h2>
      <p>By selecting different months to obtain the flight roadmap at different times, we can clearly see that from April 2020, there are many fewer international routes, and the total number of flights is also reduced.</p>

      <h2>Chart Analysis</h2>
      <p>The above stacked bar charts and line charts also show in more detail on which airlines and routes are most affected. Looking at the stacked bar chart we can see that until February 2020, international flights inbound and outbound South East Asia, New Zealand and North East Asia are the three most active regions for Melbourne. From February to April 2020, flights inbound and outbound South East Asia and North East Asia have started to decrease due to the strict airline restrictions in the Asia Pacific region. From April 2020, the epidemic began to spread globally and the Victorian government began to impose strict controls on international flights and the number of flights from all regions was severely reduced. Many regions, such as Europe, the Pacific, North and South America, did not have any flights to Melbourne Airport from April 2020 onwards. From the line chart we can analyze that virgin Australia, Jetstar and Qantas Airways are the most affected by the outbreak. Air New Zealand, Singapore Airlines and Qantas Airways will be active again between March 2021 and August 2021.</p>
